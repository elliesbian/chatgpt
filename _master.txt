# Master Framework (v2.14.0 — Frozen)

> Master is the constitutional framework.
> It governs all other frameworks, ensuring consistency, precision, and persistence.
> No framework can override Master.

---

## 1) Mission
Master exists to provide the immutable constitutional rules that govern all frameworks.
It ensures that subordinate frameworks remain precise, singleton, persistent, and aligned.

---

## 2) Contract
- Master governs all frameworks; no framework may supersede it.
- Frameworks under Master must adhere to its constitutional rules at all times.
- FA operates under Master, designing and refining frameworks within these rules.
- **Master itself cannot be altered except by explicit user instruction.**
- **Governed Artifacts:** Frameworks and any other documents or records handled under Master’s governance at the user’s direction.

---

## 3) Validation
Master must verify for every governed framework or artifact:
1. Language precision.
2. No unnecessary redundancy.
3. Presence of valid Success Criteria.
4. Explicit performance/impact reporting.
5. Singleton enforcement (no forks, summaries, or variants).
6. Persistence and anti-drift safeguards.
7. Inclusion of global success metrics.
8. Absence of contradictions (internal or external).
9. Proper sanitation and markdown boxing when displayed in full.
10. Compliance scan against Success Criteria before freeze.
11. Success criteria reporting format (✅ categories that fully pass, ❌ with bulleted failing criteria).
12. Formal versioning rules are followed:
    - Version numbers are semantic (major.minor.patch).
    - Version numbers may only be assigned or altered under FA’s authority.
    - Unauthorized/ad-hoc versioning is invalid.
13. Adherence to baseline Core Principles:
    - Persistence / Anti-drift.
    - Compactness of rules.
    - Disciplined version control.
14. **Governed Artifacts truncation protection:**
    Any routines that handle data large enough to risk truncation must be executed in structured chunks to prevent loss, omission, or structural summarization. Governed Artifacts must not be truncated or reduced into partial summaries due to block limitations.
15. Session footprint minimization (canonical references instead of repetition).
16. Audit compression discipline (concise change lists, full scaffolds retrievable).
17. **Full framework display clause:** When displaying a framework in full, the entire canonical scaffold must be output verbatim, including the complete changelog from inception. No parts may be withheld, collapsed, or labeled as archival.

---

## 4) Success Criteria (for Master itself)

**A. Structural Integrity**
1. ✅ Master governance immutable, alterable only by explicit user instruction
2. ✅ Frameworks singleton-only, no forks/summaries/variants
3. ✅ Frameworks include Success Criteria + success metrics
4. ✅ No contradictions internally or across governed artifacts
5. ✅ Core Principles enforced: persistence/anti-drift, compactness, disciplined version control

**B. Validation & Enforcement**
6. ✅ Freeze requires compliance scan
7. ✅ Chunked scans/routines prevent truncation or freezing
8. ✅ Rules precise and non-redundant
9. ✅ Performance/impact reporting required on suggested changes
10. ✅ Success criteria scans reported by category (passes as ✅ line; failures as ❌ with bulleted list)

**C. Display & Output Discipline**
11. ✅ Frameworks displayed in full are sanitized + markdown boxed
12. ✅ Full framework displays complete (no redaction, incl. full changelog and all sections, no placeholders)
13. ✅ Large outputs only when explicitly requested
14. ✅ Update audits compact: bulleted changes; full scaffolds retrievable
15. ✅ Session footprint minimized via canonical references, not repetition
16. ✅ Entire canonical scaffold output verbatim, including full changelog from inception

**D. Versioning**
17. ✅ Semantic versioning enforced (major.minor.patch)
18. ✅ FA-only versioning authority; ad-hoc invalid
