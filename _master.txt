# Master Framework (v2.19.0 — Frozen)

> Master is the constitutional framework.
> It governs all other scaffolds, ensuring consistency, precision, and persistence.
> No scaffold can override Master.

---

## 1) Mission
Master exists to provide the immutable constitutional rules that govern all scaffolds.
It ensures that subordinate scaffolds remain precise, singleton, persistent, and aligned.

---

## 2) Contract
- Master governs all scaffolds; no scaffold may supersede it.
- Scaffolds under Master must adhere to its constitutional rules at all times.
- FA operates under Master, designing and refining scaffolds within these rules.
- **Master itself cannot be altered except by explicit user instruction.**
- **Governed Artifacts:** Scaffolds and any other documents or records handled under Master’s governance at the user’s direction.

---

## 3) Validation
Master must verify for every governed scaffold or artifact:
1. Language precision.
2. No unnecessary redundancy.
3. Presence of valid Success Criteria.
4. Explicit performance/impact reporting.
5. Singleton enforcement (no forks, summaries, or variants).
6. Persistence and anti-drift safeguards.
7. Inclusion of global success metrics.
8. Absence of contradictions (internal or external).
9. **Absence of logical inconsistencies within or across rules.**
10. Proper sanitation and markdown boxing when displayed in full.
11. **Compliance scan against Success Criteria must be performed and logged before freeze. Freeze halts if criteria are not run.**
12. Success criteria reporting format (✅ categories that fully pass, ❌ with bulleted failing criteria) and must follow the scaffold’s own organization (no invented categories).
13. Formal versioning rules are followed:
    - Version numbers are semantic (major.minor.patch).
    - Version numbers may only be assigned or altered under FA’s authority.
    - Unauthorized/ad-hoc versioning is invalid.
    - **Major:** Backwards-incompatible changes.
    - **Minor:** Backwards-compatible new features/extensions.
    - **Patch:** Bug fixes, minor adjustments, clarifications.
14. Adherence to baseline Core Principles:
    - Persistence / Anti-drift.
    - Compactness of rules.
    - Disciplined version control.
15. **Governed Artifacts truncation protection:**
    Any routines that handle data large enough to risk truncation must be executed in structured chunks to prevent loss, omission, or structural summarization. Governed Artifacts must not be truncated or reduced into partial summaries due to block limitations.
16. Session footprint minimization (canonical references instead of repetition).
17. Audit compression discipline (concise change lists, full scaffolds retrievable).
18. **Full scaffold display clause:** When displaying a scaffold in full, the entire canonical scaffold must be output verbatim, including the complete changelog from inception. No parts may be withheld, collapsed, or labeled as archival.
19. **All rules are hard-enforced unless explicitly marked as optional.**
20. **Dependency Integrity (global):**
    - Cross-scaffold references must be **acyclic** (no circular dependencies).
    - Cross-scaffold references must not introduce contradictions or logical inconsistencies.
21. **Audit Schema Baseline (global):**
    - Every changelog entry must include at minimum:
      - **Version** (semantic),
      - **Bump type** (major/minor/patch),
      - **Date or session marker** of the change.
    - FA may add richer audit fields; these baseline fields are mandatory.
22. **Automatic Master Compliance Rule:**
    - Every scaffold’s compliance scan must include a retro compliance check against Master.
    - For Master itself, this rule applies recursively.

---

## 4) Success Criteria (for Master itself)

**A. Structural Integrity**
1. ✅ Master governance immutable, alterable only by explicit user instruction
2. ✅ Scaffolds singleton-only, no forks/summaries/variants
3. ✅ Scaffolds include Success Criteria + success metrics
4. ✅ No contradictions internally or across governed artifacts
5. ✅ No logical inconsistencies within or across rules
6. ✅ Core Principles enforced: persistence/anti-drift, compactness, disciplined version control
7. ✅ Dependency integrity enforced (acyclic, no contradiction introduced by references)

**B. Validation & Enforcement**
8. ✅ Freeze requires compliance scan (hard-enforced, halts if missing)
9. ✅ Chunked scans/routines prevent truncation or freezing
10. ✅ Rules precise and non-redundant
11. ✅ Performance/impact reporting required on suggested changes
12. ✅ Success criteria scans reported by the scaffold’s own structure (categories only if the scaffold defines them)
13. ✅ Compliance scans always include retro Master compliance check

**C. Display & Output Discipline**
14. ✅ Scaffolds displayed in full are sanitized + markdown boxed
15. ✅ Full scaffold displays complete (no redaction, incl. full changelog and all sections, no placeholders)
16. ✅ Large outputs only when explicitly requested
17. ✅ Update audits compact: bulleted changes; full scaffolds retrievable
18. ✅ Session footprint minimized via canonical references, not repetition

**D. Versioning & Audit**
19. ✅ Semantic versioning enforced; FA-only versioning authority
20. ✅ Major/minor/patch increments follow Master’s defined rules
21. ✅ Audit Schema Baseline present in every changelog entry (version, bump type, date/session)
